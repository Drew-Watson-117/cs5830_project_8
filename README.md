# Project 8

## Project Overview

This is a short, exploratory project. You will find a dataset and apply both decision trees and neural networks to it for classification. You don't need to use the same explanatory variables for both types of classification but it will be helpful if at least some of the variables overlap.

For the decision trees you should visualize at least two trees (using code we saw in class) at different maximum depths. Discuss the effect the depth has on bias and variance. Discuss the choices the algorithm makes in which attributes to split on. For example, at a given tree level do all nodes split on the same attribute? Why or why not?

For the neural networks, you should try at least three different architectures with varying numbers of hidden layers and nodes in each layer. Visualize each architecture. You can use code included in the lecture neural networks code for visualization or you can use a different visualization system (this one

We used sklearn's implementation of neural networks in the example code, but you are welcome to use other implementations (e.g. TensorFlow) if you choose. Discuss any correlations you see, or the lack thereof, between your edge weights and the decision trees.

## Dataset Descriptions

- `magic04.csv` - desc

## File Structure

- `project8.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install Python (version 3.x or above) and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.
4. Add a `data` folder to the main directory.
5. Add in the datasets

## Usage

- Open the `project8.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS code to view the analysis.
- The notebook is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis.
- You can modify and rerun the code cells to explore different hypotheses or perspectives.
